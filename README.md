# cervical_cancer_prediction
This repository contains code and data processing pipelines for building predictive models to detect cervical cancer based on clinical and behavioral features.

## Problem Statement
Cervical cancer is a preventable disease if detected early. We aim to build interpretable and accurate models that can assist in screening and risk stratification.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and imputation
- Feature engineering and selection
- Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, AdaBoost, MLP and CatBoost.)
- Grid Search for hyperparameters
- SHAP explainability
- Model evaluation (AUC, confusion matrix, PR curve)



## Dataset
We use the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, which contains demographic, behavioral, and medical history data.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nieqizhao/cervical-cancer-prediction.git
cd cervical-cancer-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
